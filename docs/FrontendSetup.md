# Frontend Setup 

Follow the below steps to setup the Frontend locally. We are using `npm` as the package manager. So make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed in your system.

**If not installed, please read [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).**
## Installing dependencies ‚è≥

- Open your terminal and navigate to the `Milan` directory.
- Type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Once the installation is done, you can start the frontend server by typing `npm run dev`.
- This should start the frontend server on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Techstack overview üåÄ

- We are currently using `ReactJS v18` along with `vite v3` as the frontend framework.
- We using `CSS (Bootstrap v5)` for the styling.
- We have also implemented `service workers` which might not run in the development environment but will be used in the production environment. Please clear your cache if you are facing any issues.
- To test service workers in development environment, you can run `npm run build` and then `serve dist` to serve the production build locally.
- Then you can navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the production build running locally with service workers which can be found in `Application tab -> Service workers`  in the dev tools.
- List of all the other dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.


## Coding standards üîê

- We are using `ESLint` and `Prettier` for linting and formatting.
- Maintain the same coding standards as the rest of the codebase. 
- Follow good naming conventions for the files, variables and functions along with proper documentation (if needed).
- We also use `husky` and `lint-staged` to run the linter and formatter before every commit. Read about this in our [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Maintain a good folder structure, incase you use anu new components or pages make sure you put them in the right folder.
- If you are using any new dependencies, make sure you mention them in the PR.
- If you are using any new Image , compress it using [online tools]("https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image") and then use it in the project.
- **Remember**, writing readable and clean code while following the coding standards is the best thing for any developer.

## Setting up the `.env` file 

We use a `.env` file inside the root of the directory. You must create a `.env` file similar to [.env.example](../.env.example) file.

`HOST_NAME` variable is used to set host name which tell vite to use and listen to only.

`EXPOSE_NETWORK` This variable use to tell vite to listen to ur Network IP address and localhost. it useful if you want to access your vite server directory from your network just like how Webserver and FTP/SFTP used to listen on network.
